# Holochain Development Kit for Rust based apps
Holochain apps' zome functions and validation code are represented as WASM binaries. In order to provide convenient access to the Holochain API functions and callbacks without forcing app developers to deal with pointers and de-/serialization of parameters, we provide HDK libraries that provide bindings for several source languages such as Rust and TypeScript.

This crate is the Rust implementation.

## State
Only empty function stubs!
